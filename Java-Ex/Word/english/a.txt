My favorite, and the one I implement by default, is recursive backtracking. It is fast, easy to understand, and straightforward to implement. Youâ€™ll need sufficient memory to store the entire maze in memory, though, and it requires stack space again proportional to the size of the maze, so for exceptionally large mazes it can be fairly inefficient. But for most mazes, it works a charm.
